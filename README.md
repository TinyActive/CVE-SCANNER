# CVE-SCANNER - Automated Linux CVE Scanner
Overview
As a Cloud Security Engineer, I often found it challenging to manually scan Linux servers for CVEs in installed packages.
Keeping track of vulnerabilities across various packages and distributions was time-consuming and error-prone.
To address this issue, I created CVE-SCANNER, a simple Python tool that automates the process of scanning installed packages for CVEs on Debian and RedHat Linux systems.
CVE-SCANNER fetches real-time CVE data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) maintained by NIST, ensuring that you have the latest information on vulnerabilities affecting your system.

Features
Easy-to-Use: CVE-SCANNER is designed to be user-friendly. You can run it via the command line interface (CLI) with simple commands.
Package Specific Scan: Scan for CVEs in a specific package by providing its name, e.g., CVE-SCANNER.py -s "apache".
Output Formats: Generate reports in JSON or HTML format by using the --json or --html flags.
Full System Scan: Perform a scan for all installed packages without specifying a specific package name, e.g., CVE-SCANNER.py --json or CVE-SCANNER.py --html.
The output will show the following:

1. The package name which the CVE was found for.
2. The current package version installed,
3. The CVE-ID, according to NIST's NVD.
4. A short description related to the CVE.
5. A severity level (from LOW to CRITICAL).

## Requirements
* Root privileges to install the desired pip packages
* Python 3
* Pip
* Python libraries: BeautifulSoup and requests
You can install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

## Usage
Here are some examples of how to use CVE-SCANNER:

## Running the tool with -h or --help will give you the following:

```
python3 cve-scanner-debian.py --help

usage: cve-scanner-debian.py [-h] [--html] [--json] [-s SEARCH]

Scan all installed packages for CVEs and export results in HTML or JSON format.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --html                Export results in HTML format.
  --json                Export results in JSON format.
  -s SEARCH, --search SEARCH
                        Search for CVEs related to a specific package.
```

## Scan a specific package (e.g., Apache) and generate a JSON report on ubuntu, debian:

``` python3 cve-scanner-debian.py -s "apache" --json ```

## Scan a specific package (e.g., Apache) and generate an HTML report:

``` cve-scanner-debian.py -s "apache" --html ```
Perform a full system scan and generate a JSON report:

``` python3 cve-scanner-debian.py --json ```

## Output sample for json report:

Perform a full system scan and generate an HTML report with auto detect OS support ubuntu, debian, redhat, centos

``` python3 CVE-SCANNER.py --html ```

## Output example for html report:
